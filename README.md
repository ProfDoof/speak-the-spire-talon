Sure you've walked your way to the top, but have you talked your way to the top?
This Slay the Spire mod aims to let you do just that: play the game Slay the
Spire with only voice commands.

**üõ†Ô∏è Note: currently in beta. Works on Mac, untested on Windows. üõ†Ô∏è**

## Installation

There five different elements that you will need to install to get Say the Spire
up and running. What could go wrong?

1. Talon Voice software: free, amazing speech engine and Python-based framework
1. talonhub/community: set of voice commands scripts written by the community
1. brollin/say-the-spire-talon: (this repo) Say the Spire Talon voice commands
1. Slay the Spire, installed via Steam
1. Say the Spire Mod, and the mods it depends on

The first two will be familiar to prior Talon users. There isn't anything
special about step (3) besides putting this repository inside your Talon user
directory, so feel free to skip the next section if doing that is familiar to
you.
